🚀 Project Highlight: Analyzing Netflix Asian TV Series for Merchandise Opportunities 🎬

Over the past two years, Asian TV series on Netflix have gained immense popularity with international audiences, driving trends across various platforms. My recent project focused on identifying these trends and popular characters to create targeted merchandise for online shopping platforms.

🔍 Objectives:

Built a classification model to identify show titles from subreddit posts.
Conducted sentiment analysis to gauge fan engagement and determine which shows have the largest potential for merchandise.
🌟 Methodology:

Web-scraped Reddit posts for the top Netflix series: Squid Game, Alice in Borderland, and Physical: 100.
Analyzed the similarities between the shows, focusing on their themes of competition for survival or monetary rewards.
This project provided key insights into fan engagement and identified the best opportunities for creating and marketing merchandise to fans worldwide.

Excited to apply these skills in future data-driven projects!
